# Project Title

## Flatdango Movie Ticket Purchase App

# Project Description

Flatdango is a web application that allows users to purchase movie tickets from the Flatiron Movie Theater. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses fetch functions to retrieve data from a local database stored in a db.json file. The app displays a list of available movies and allows users to select a movie, choose a showtime, and purchase tickets. If a movie is sold out, a "sold out" badge is displayed next to the movie title.

# Project Setup

To run the app, open the index.html file and ensure that the json-server is running to watch the db.json file. The database is stored locally on a db.json file.
